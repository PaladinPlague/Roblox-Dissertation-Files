**IMPORTANT INFO ON EXECUTING SOURCE CODE**

The code within this file was developed within Roblox Creator Studio meaning this code will only execute within Roblox Creator Studio. Parts such as Models, UI, Sound Effects, Maps and Controls are held within Roblox.

To gain access to the WorkSpace within the Roblox Studio, Contact me at mark.mccafferty.2019@uni.strath.ac.uk to be added as a Collaborator. You will require a Roblox account to access the studio.

The files within this folder are set up to replicate the structure of the Creator Studio workspace that I have changed since the files within creator studio are not held locally and cannot be exported from the system.

Certain files such as weapon files will only hold one example of the ARShoot and Shoot scripts as they are the same script with minor changed values.

Any GUI elements exist within roblox but images will be provided within each file a GUI is used
