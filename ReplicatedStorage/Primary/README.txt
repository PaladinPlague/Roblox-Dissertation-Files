The contents of this folder contains examples of ARShoot, Shoot and Damage Scripts. These files are roughly the same with minor differences.

Within ARShoot and Shoot any variables under Editable Values are changed between each weapon file. Within damage the damage variable is changed between weapons.

The ARShoot and Damage scripts are taken from the ACSM4A1 | AR tool, while the shoot script was taken from the Dragunov | Sniper tool
